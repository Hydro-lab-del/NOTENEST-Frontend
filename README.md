🔑 Authentication Flow

User logs in/registers → backend sets secure httpOnly cookies (access + refresh tokens).

Frontend makes API calls with:

fetch(url, { credentials: "include" });


If cookie expires → backend auto-refreshes or returns 401.

Frontend handles 401 by redirecting to login.

🌍 Deployment

You can deploy the frontend for free on:

Cloudflare Pages (recommended for same-domain auth with backend)

Vercel / Netlify (may require backend proxy configs)

📌 Next Steps

Add notes CRUD UI (create, edit, delete notes).

Improve mobile responsiveness.

Add dark mode toggle.
